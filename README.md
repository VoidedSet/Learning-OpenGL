## OpenGL in C++
This repo is mantained so that i can track the progress I made in Open GL.

Initial step for my future projects.

Used GLFW as my window api and input handler
OpenGL as my renderer or graphics api
Cpp as my base language
Open GL Shader Language for defining vertex and fragment shaders.
